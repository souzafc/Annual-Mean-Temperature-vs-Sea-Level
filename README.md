# Annual-Mean-Temperature-vs-Sea-Level
- This is an experimental and personal project using open data from Nasa and sealevel.info.
- Here we are trying to have some perspective on the effect of the raising in global temperatures in the sea level.
- Of course, there are many other factors involved in the rise of the sea level, but this is just a simplification, and it is not validated.
