# Annual-Mean-Temperature-vs-Sea-Level
# This is a personal project using data from Nasa and sealevel.info.
# Here we are trying to have some perspective on the effect of the raising in global temperatures in the sea level.
# Of course, there are many other factors involved in the rise of the sea level, but this is just a simplification, not validated.
